        <h1>Emphasis and Strengthened Text</h1>
        <p>My top recommended <strong>YouTube</strong> channels to watch. I like the cooking science videos made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea"><em>Adam Ragusea</em></a>, he was a Journalism professor at Mercer University in Georgia State prior to pursuing <strong>YouTube</strong> fulltime. I also like watching videos made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thank9stars"><em>June Xie</em></a>, she livestreams on YouTube and occasionally posts longer form videos. Until recently, she was a Senior Food Producer at Delish Magazine.</p>
        <p>I also like watching Minecraft playthrough and tutorial videos, I primarily watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Pixlriffs"><em>Pixlriffs</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NotPaulGG"><em>PaulGG</em></a>. I used to also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WadZee"><em>WadZee</em></a> until he went on a hiatus.</p>

        <h2>...Separating Content from Presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The tags of <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> are better choice than using the <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i> tags because they serve to emphasize the importance of words and their meaning while also providing that visual difference. The tags for bold and italics only visually distinguish text from the regular text.</p>
