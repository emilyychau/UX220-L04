        <h1 style="text-align:left">Emphasis and Strengthened Text</h1>
        <p>Here are some of my top recommended <strong>YouTube</strong> channels to watch. I like the cooking science videos made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea"><em>Adam Ragusea</em></a>, he was a Journalism professor at Mercer University in Georgia State prior to pursuing <strong>YouTube</strong> fulltime. I also like watching videos made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thank9stars"><em>June Xie</em></a>, she livestreams on YouTube and occasionally posts longer form videos. Until recently, she was a Senior Food Producer at Delish Magazine. She popularized their Budget Eats series, which is where I first saw her food-video content. </p>
        <p>I also like watching Minecraft playthrough and tutorial videos, I primarily watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Pixlriffs"><em>Pixlriffs</em></a>'s Minecraft Survival Guide (S3) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NotPaulGG"><em>PaulGG</em></a>'s 100 Days Series variants. I used to also watch lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WadZee"><em>WadZee</em></a> until he went on a hiatus.</p>

        <h2>...Separating Content from Presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The strong and emphasis tags are better choice than using the <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i> tags because they serve to emphasize the importance of words and their meaning while also providing that visual difference. The tags for bold and italics only visually distinguishes text from the regular text, it does not imply a difference or change in the meaning of the sentence. It is also easier to parse through the HTML code and identify text that is tagged with the strong or emphasis tags, compared to the one letter tags for bold or italics which could be easily missed while skimming through code. </p>
